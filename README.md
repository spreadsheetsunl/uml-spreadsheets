# UML Spreadsheets
A UML-based visual language that provides a controlled specification and generation of spreadsheets, covering the most common spreadsheets patterns, and that is compatible with the most widely used spreadsheet applications.

The spreadsheets generated from this domain-specific language will guide the users so they make less mistakes, based on the restrictions imposed in the modeling phase.
